What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git creates the metadata files for controlling the repository
It is needed to start committing data

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
it gives you a space where you can check the commit content before sending it to the current repository

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
it help me to compare the changes that will be committed agains the working directory.
