When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we work on the a collaboration project or if i want to work on differents machines

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
*Branchs: there are tags on the commits tree, marks one leaf of the tree.
*Clones: these are copies of one repository to be use as a new repository
*Forks:  these are clones but made on github

I'll use branches when i am work on a new funcitonality or i am going to experiment with something and i don't want to change the functional/production code.
I'll use clone if i want to take some code as a base for a functionality that i need but i dont have access to modify.
I'll use forks in the same case of clone, but if the code is in github and i want to keep it in my github account. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote store locally?
you can check the state of a branch without internet access

How would you collaborate without usig git or github? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would use svn as a collaboration repo, i think it would be harder to maintain the svn.
