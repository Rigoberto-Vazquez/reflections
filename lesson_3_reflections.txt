When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we work on the a collaboration project or if i want to work on differents machines

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
*Branchs: there are tags on the commits tree, marks one leaf of the tree.
*Clones: these are copies of one repository to be use as a new repository
*Forks:  these are clones but made on github

I'll use branches when i am work on a new funcitonality or i am going to experiment with something and i don't want to change the functional/production code.
I'll use clone if i want to take some code as a base for a functionality that i need but i dont have access to modify.
I'll use forks in the same case of clone, but if the code is in github and i want to keep it in my github account. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote store locally?
you can check the state of a branch without internet access

How would you collaborate without usig git or github? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would use svn as a collaboration repo, i think it would be harder to maintain the svn.

When would you want to make changes in a separeted branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
I would make changes in a branch before add them into master when the change can break all the code or when the change it is big enough to change the nature of the 
functionality. changes in the master is more direct and easy but error prone. changes in a branch is more complex to do, but it can be safest.
